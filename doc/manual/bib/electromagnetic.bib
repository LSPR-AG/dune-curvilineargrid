	Abstract = {We provide optimal parameter estimates and a priori error
 bounds for symmetric discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
 discretisations of the second-order indefinite time-harmonic
 Maxwell equations. More specifically, we consider two
 variations of symmetric DG methods: the interior penalty DG
 (IP-DG) method and one that makes use of the local lifting
 operator in the flux formulation. As a novelty, our parameter
 estimates and error bounds are (i) valid in the pre-asymptotic
 regime; (ii) solely depend on the geometry and the polynomial
 order; and (iii) are free of unspecified constants. Such
 estimates are particularly important in three-dimensional (3D)
 simulations because in practice many 3D computations occur in
 the pre-asymptotic regime. Therefore, it is vital that our
 numerical experiments that accompany the theoretical results
 are also in 3D. They are carried out on tetrahedral meshes
 with high-order (p=1, 2, 3, 4) hierarchic H(curl)-conforming
 polynomial basis functions.},

	Abstract = {We have fabricated silver nanoprisms of 100--600 nm side length by focussed ion beam lithography and measured the light intensity scattering spectra using dark-field microscopy. Two resonance peaks due to localized surface plasmon excitation were observed in the spectra and their central frequency shown to depend on the prism size. The near-field electromagnetic intensity distribution with TE-polarized light at the vacuum wavelength of 632.8 nm was measured. We have obtained a much lower light intensity enhancement than previously numerically predicated. However, scattering spectra obtained numerically, taking into account roundness of the prism corners, agree well with experimental ones. At the same time, the numerically determined field distribution was different to the near-field intensity obtained experimentally. Our results suggest the particular shape of the corner region of the prism is a key factor for obtaining a large light intensity enhancement and shaping the local field distribution.},

	Abstract = { A central goal in bioanalytics is to determine the concentration of and interactions between biomolecules. Nanotechnology allows performing such analyses in a highly parallel, low-cost, and miniaturized fashion. Here we report on label-free volume, concentration, and mobility analysis of single protein molecules and nanoparticles during their diffusion through a subattoliter detection volume, confined by a 100 nm aperture in a thin gold film. A high concentration of small fluorescent molecules renders the aqueous solution in the aperture brightly fluorescent. Nonfluorescent analytes diffusing into the aperture displace the fluorescent molecules in the solution, leading to a decrease of the detected fluorescence signal, while analytes diffusing out of the aperture return the fluorescence level. The resulting fluorescence fluctuations provide direct information on the volume, concentration, and mobility of the nonfluorescent analytes through fluctuation analysis in both time and amplitude. },

Both the fundamental and the SH electric fields are computed using the method of moments and periodic Green\&\#x2019;s function evaluated with the Ewald\&\#x2019;s method. The accuracy of the method is carefully assessed using two specific cases, namely the surface plasmon enhancement of SHG from a gold film and the SHG from L-shaped nanoparticle arrays.

	Abstract = {Abstract. 
                  Compound plasmonic resonances arise due to the interaction between discrete and continuous metallic nanostructures. Such combined nanostructures provide a versatility and tunability beyond that of most other metallic nanostructures. In order to observe such resonances and their tunability, multiple nanostructure arrays composed of periodic metallic gratings of varying width and an underlying metallic film should be studied. Large-area compound plasmonic structures composed of various Au grating arrays with sub-100 nm features spaced nanometers above an Au film were fabricated using extreme ultraviolet interference lithography. Reflection spectra, via both numerical simulations and experimental measurements over a wide range of incidence angles and excitation wavelengths, show the existence of not only the usual propagating and localized plasmon resonances, but also compound plasmonic resonances. These resonances exhibit not only propagative features, but also a spectral evolution with 
varying grating width. Additionally, a reduction of the width of the grating elements results in coupling with the localized dipolar resonance of the grating elements and thus plasmon hybridization. This newly acquired perspective on the various interactions present in such a plasmonic system will aid in an increased understanding of the mechanisms at play when designing plasmonic structures composed of both discrete and continuous elements.},

@article{butet+2014a,
	Abstract = { The evaluation of distances as small as few nanometers using optical waves is a very challenging task that can pave the way for the development of new applications in biotechnology and nanotechnology. In this article, we propose a new measurement method based on the control of the nonlinear optical response of plasmonic nanostructures by means of Fano resonances. It is shown that Fano resonances resulting from the coupling between a bright mode and a dark mode at the fundamental wavelength enable unprecedented and direct manipulation of the nonlinear electromagnetic sources at the nanoscale. In the case of second harmonic generation from gold nanodolmens, the different nonlinear sources distributions induced by the different coupling regimes are clearly revealed in the far-field distribution. Hence, the configuration of the nanostructure can be accurately determined in 3-dimensions by recording the wave scattered at the second harmonic wavelength. Indeed, the conformation of the different 
elements building the system is encoded in the nonlinear far-field distribution, making second harmonic generation a promising tool for reading 3-dimension plasmonic nanorulers. Furthemore, it is shown that 3-dimension plasmonic nanorulers can be implemented with simpler geometries than in the linear regime while providing complete information on the structure conformation, including the top nanobar position and orientation. },

	Abstract = {A nonoverlapping domain decomposition method is proposed for the finite element solution of the scattering problem by electrically large, inhomogeneous, 
infinite cylinders of arbitrary cross section. To minimize the size of the total computational domain, a second-order-absorbing boundary condition (ABC) is applied upon an outer boundary
 of arbitrary shape which may be conformal to the surface of the scatterer. This domain is then partitioned into concentric subdomains circumscribing the object. A second-order transmission condition,
 derived from the ABC, is prescribed upon the interfaces between two adjacent subdomains. This particular configuration is responsible for the fast convergence of the domain decomposition iterative
 algorithm, which is parallelizable. Numerical results obtained with a nonparallelized computer code are presented, which emphasize the superiority of this technique in terms of memory storage 
requirements and computing times over the standard finite element approach, as well as over the rigorous hybrid finite element-integral equation formulation},

Further, since information exchange in DG only involves neighboring elements, high efficiency in parallelization can be achieved. The conformal perfect matched layer (PML) with continuously changing material property tensors in space is adopted to truncate the computational domain. And the model presented in this paper treats the material property tensor in PML region with polynomial representation using a universal array approach.},

	Abstract = {In this paper a high-order finite element method with curvilinear elements is proposed for the simulation of plasmonic structures. Most finite element packages use low order basis functions and non-curved elements, which is very costly for demanding problems such as the simulation of
  nanoantennas. To enhance the performance of finite elements, we use curvilinear quadrilateral elements to calculate the near-field from an impinging plane wave with second order absorbing boundary conditions. The magnetic field amplitude on the surface of one object is compared with a computation
  based on a multiple multipole expansion. Moreover, the convergence behavior of <i>p</i>-FEM with absorbing boundary conditions motivate an adaptive strategy of polynomial degree enhancement and enlargement of the domain.},
