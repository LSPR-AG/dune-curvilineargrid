	Abstract = {We provide optimal parameter estimates and a priori error
 bounds for symmetric discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
 discretisations of the second-order indefinite time-harmonic
 Maxwell equations. More specifically, we consider two
 variations of symmetric DG methods: the interior penalty DG
 (IP-DG) method and one that makes use of the local lifting
 operator in the flux formulation. As a novelty, our parameter
 estimates and error bounds are (i) valid in the pre-asymptotic
 regime; (ii) solely depend on the geometry and the polynomial
 order; and (iii) are free of unspecified constants. Such
 estimates are particularly important in three-dimensional (3D)
 simulations because in practice many 3D computations occur in
 the pre-asymptotic regime. Therefore, it is vital that our
 numerical experiments that accompany the theoretical results
 are also in 3D. They are carried out on tetrahedral meshes
 with high-order (p=1, 2, 3, 4) hierarchic H(curl)-conforming
 polynomial basis functions.},

	Abstract = {A nonoverlapping domain decomposition method is proposed for the finite element solution of the scattering problem by electrically large, inhomogeneous, 
infinite cylinders of arbitrary cross section. To minimize the size of the total computational domain, a second-order-absorbing boundary condition (ABC) is applied upon an outer boundary
 of arbitrary shape which may be conformal to the surface of the scatterer. This domain is then partitioned into concentric subdomains circumscribing the object. A second-order transmission condition,
 derived from the ABC, is prescribed upon the interfaces between two adjacent subdomains. This particular configuration is responsible for the fast convergence of the domain decomposition iterative
 algorithm, which is parallelizable. Numerical results obtained with a nonparallelized computer code are presented, which emphasize the superiority of this technique in terms of memory storage 
requirements and computing times over the standard finite element approach, as well as over the rigorous hybrid finite element-integral equation formulation},

	Abstract = {Non-overlapping domain decomposition (DD) methods with complex first order Robin-type transmission conditions (TCs) provide an efficient iterative solution for Maxwell's equation. Unfortunately, the first order \{TCs\} do not effectively account for some eigenmodes of the system matrix, which limits the scalability of the methods. In this work, we examine two \{TCs\} with a second order transverse derivative to improve the method's performance. A detailed convergence analysis of the two \{TCs\} is presented. We then investigate the use of the two second order \{TCs\} in non-conformal and non-overlapping one way \{DD\} methods. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on some model problems and on several problems of practical interest. },

	Abstract = {A fast and accurate full-wave technique based on the dual-primal finite element tearing and interconnecting method and the second-order transmission condition is presented for large-scale three-dimensional photonic device simulations. The technique decomposes a general three-dimensional electromagnetic problem into smaller subdomain problems so that parallel computing can be performed on distributed-memory computer clusters to reduce the simulation time significantly. With the electric fields computed everywhere, photonic device parameters such as transmission and reflection coefficients are extracted. Several photonic devices, with simulation volumes up to 1.9{\texttimes}104 ($\lambda$/navg)3 and modeled with over one hundred million unknowns, are simulated to demonstrate the application, efficiency, and capability of this technique. The simulations show good agreement with experimental results and in a special case with a simplified two-dimensional simulation.},

	Abstract = {Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element method is well-suited on unstructured meshes for high order approximation with the freedom of choosing the order of basis functions in each element locally. Moreover, DG can handle complicated geometries with curved boundary easily. Further, since information exchange in DG only involves neighboring elements, high efficiency in parallelization can be achieved. The conformal perfect matched layer (PML) with continuously changing material property tensors in space is adopted to truncate the computational domain. And the model presented in this paper treats the material property tensor in PML region with polynomial representation using a universal array approach.},

  nanoantennas. To enhance the performance of finite elements, we use curvilinear quadrilateral elements to calculate the near-field from an impinging plane wave with second order absorbing boundary conditions. The magnetic field amplitude on the surface of one object is compared with a computation
  based on a multiple multipole expansion. Moreover, the convergence behavior of <i>p</i>-FEM with absorbing boundary conditions motivate an adaptive strategy of polynomial degree enhancement and enlargement of the domain.},
