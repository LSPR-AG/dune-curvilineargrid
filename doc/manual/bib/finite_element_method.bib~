	Abstract = {Gmsh is an open-source three-dimensional nite element grid generator with a build-in CAD engine and post-processor. Its design goal is to provide a fast, light and user-friendly meshing tool with parametric input and advanced visualization capabilities. This paper presents the overall philosophy, the main design choices and some of the original algorithms implemented in Gmsh.},

	Abstract = {We present an iterative domain decomposition method to solve the Helmholtz equation and related optimal control problems. The proof of convergence of this method relies on energy techniques. This method leads to efficient algorithms for the numerical resolution of harmonic wave propagation problems in homogeneous and heterogeneous media. },

	Abstract = {We introduce a residual-based a posteriori error indicator for
 discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of H(curl; {\OE}{\copyright})-elliptic
 boundary value problems that arise in eddy current models. We
 show that the indicator is both reliable and efficient with
 respect to the approximation error measured in terms of a
 natural energy norm. We validate the performance of the
 indicator within an adaptive mesh refinement procedure and
 show its asymptotic exactness for a range of test problems.},

	Abstract = {We describe a practical procedure for the triangulation of arbitrary n-dimensional regular bounded domains by isoparametric simplicial elements preserving the optimal order of accuracy. Along similar lines we prove general error estimates for the finite element solution of second order elliptic problems. Various kinds of nonhomogeneous boundary conditions can be dealt with, such as Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin boundary conditions.},
