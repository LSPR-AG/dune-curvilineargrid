One of the main advantages of the approach is the flexibility and simplicity of working directly in real space where the different fields are discretized on a grid{,} combined with competitive numerical performance and great potential for parallelization. These properties constitute a great advantage at the time of implementing and testing new physical models. Based on our experience with the Octopus code{,} in this article we discuss how the real-space approach has allowed for the recent development of new ideas for the simulation of electronic systems. Among these applications are approaches to calculate response properties{,} modeling of photoemission{,} optimal control of quantum systems{,} simulation of plasmonic systems{,} and the exact solution of the Schrodinger equation for low-dimensionality systems."}

abstract  ="Supporting substrate attached gold nanostructures display localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) properties at the visible and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. The LSPR wavelength is very responsive to the refractive index of the surrounding medium{,} allowing simple label-free biosensing when biomolecules are irreversibly adsorbed onto nanostructures. Herein{,} we show that chemically synthesized gold nanoprisms with 22 nm average edge lengths are very efficient plasmonic transducers for label-free biosensing. The LSPR properties of gold nanoprisms on silanized glass substrate were investigated and readily influenced by bulk refractive index changes and local changes very close to the sensing surface due to the analyte adsorption. The nanoprisms had a 583 nm/RIU (1.62 eV/RIU) refractive index sensitivity and a 4.9 figure of merit (FOM). In addition{,} the nanoprism surface was modified with straight chain alkanethiols. The LSPR wavelength ([small lambda]max) of chemisorbed nanoprisms on glass was very sensitive to surface modification by straight chain alkanethiols and linearly red-shifted by 2.5 nm with every methylene unit of the alkanethiol chain. Importantly{,} the biotin functionalized nanoprisms displayed red-shifts in [small lambda]max upon streptavidin (SA) binding. The lowest SA concentration was measured to be 50 pM{,} much lower than gold nanospheres{,} nanorods{,} bipyramids{,} and nanostars."}

	Abstract = {We have fabricated silver nanoprisms of 100--600 nm side length by focussed ion beam lithography and measured the light intensity scattering spectra using dark-field microscopy. Two resonance peaks due to localized surface plasmon excitation were observed in the spectra and their central frequency shown to depend on the prism size. The near-field electromagnetic intensity distribution with TE-polarized light at the vacuum wavelength of 632.8 nm was measured. We have obtained a much lower light intensity enhancement than previously numerically predicated. However, scattering spectra obtained numerically, taking into account roundness of the prism corners, agree well with experimental ones. At the same time, the numerically determined field distribution was different to the near-field intensity obtained experimentally. Our results suggest the particular shape of the corner region of the prism is a key factor for obtaining a large light intensity enhancement and shaping the local field distribution.},

Numerical experiments show that the enhancement factor may vary by many orders of magnitude depending on a fluorophoreâs transition rates or intrinsic quantum yield. For different molecules, boosting fluorescence enhancement means optimizing different factors, leading to a different ideal geometric and spectral configuration. This framework, coupled with powerful new simulation tools, will facilitate the design and characterization of fluorescence-enhancing plasmonic nanostructures as well as yield experimental access to the intrinsic properties of the molecules under study. }

	Abstract = { A central goal in bioanalytics is to determine the concentration of and interactions between biomolecules. Nanotechnology allows performing such analyses in a highly parallel, low-cost, and miniaturized fashion. Here we report on label-free volume, concentration, and mobility analysis of single protein molecules and nanoparticles during their diffusion through a subattoliter detection volume, confined by a 100 nm aperture in a thin gold film. A high concentration of small fluorescent molecules renders the aqueous solution in the aperture brightly fluorescent. Nonfluorescent analytes diffusing into the aperture displace the fluorescent molecules in the solution, leading to a decrease of the detected fluorescence signal, while analytes diffusing out of the aperture return the fluorescence level. The resulting fluorescence fluctuations provide direct information on the volume, concentration, and mobility of the nonfluorescent analytes through fluctuation analysis in both time and amplitude. },

	Abstract = {Abstract. 
                  Compound plasmonic resonances arise due to the interaction between discrete and continuous metallic nanostructures. Such combined nanostructures provide a versatility and tunability beyond that of most other metallic nanostructures. In order to observe such resonances and their tunability, multiple nanostructure arrays composed of periodic metallic gratings of varying width and an underlying metallic film should be studied. Large-area compound plasmonic structures composed of various Au grating arrays with sub-100 nm features spaced nanometers above an Au film were fabricated using extreme ultraviolet interference lithography. Reflection spectra, via both numerical simulations and experimental measurements over a wide range of incidence angles and excitation wavelengths, show the existence of not only the usual propagating and localized plasmon resonances, but also compound plasmonic resonances. These resonances exhibit not only propagative features, but also a spectral evolution with 
varying grating width. Additionally, a reduction of the width of the grating elements results in coupling with the localized dipolar resonance of the grating elements and thus plasmon hybridization. This newly acquired perspective on the various interactions present in such a plasmonic system will aid in an increased understanding of the mechanisms at play when designing plasmonic structures composed of both discrete and continuous elements.},

	Abstract = { The evaluation of distances as small as few nanometers using optical waves is a very challenging task that can pave the way for the development of new applications in biotechnology and nanotechnology. In this article, we propose a new measurement method based on the control of the nonlinear optical response of plasmonic nanostructures by means of Fano resonances. It is shown that Fano resonances resulting from the coupling between a bright mode and a dark mode at the fundamental wavelength enable unprecedented and direct manipulation of the nonlinear electromagnetic sources at the nanoscale. In the case of second harmonic generation from gold nanodolmens, the different nonlinear sources distributions induced by the different coupling regimes are clearly revealed in the far-field distribution. Hence, the configuration of the nanostructure can be accurately determined in 3-dimensions by recording the wave scattered at the second harmonic wavelength. Indeed, the conformation of the different 
elements building the system is encoded in the nonlinear far-field distribution, making second harmonic generation a promising tool for reading 3-dimension plasmonic nanorulers. Furthemore, it is shown that 3-dimension plasmonic nanorulers can be implemented with simpler geometries than in the linear regime while providing complete information on the structure conformation, including the top nanobar position and orientation. },

abstract = {The coupling between metallic nanostructures is a common and easy way to control the optical properties of plasmonic systems. Even though the coupling between plasmonic oscillators has been widely studied in the linear regime, its influence on the nonlinear optical response of metallic nanostructures has been sparsely considered. Using a surface integral equation method, we investigate the second order nonlinear optical response of plasmonic metamolecules supporting Fano resonances revealing that the typical lineshape of Fano resonances is also clearly observable in the nonlinear regime. The physical mechanisms leading to nonlinear Fano resonances are revealed by the coupled oscillator model and the symmetry subgroup decomposition. It is found that the origin of the nonlinear scattered wave, i. e. the active plasmonic oscillator, can be selectively chosen. Furthermore, interferences between nonlinear emissions are clearly observed in specific configurations. The results presented in this article pave the way for the design of efficient nonlinear plasmonic metamolecules with controlled nonlinear radiation.},
