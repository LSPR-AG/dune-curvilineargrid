Our condition enables to guarantee that an element is geometrically valid, i.e., that its Jacobian determinant is strictly positive everywhere in its reference domain. It also provides an efficient way to measure the distortion of curvilinear elements. The key feature of the method is to expand the Jacobian determinant using a polynomial basis, built using Bézier functions, that has both properties of boundedness and positivity. Numerical results show the sharpness of our estimates. "

abstract = "Abstract This paper presents a technique that allows to untangle high-order/curvilinear meshes. The technique makes use of unconstrained optimization where element Jacobians are constrained to lie in a prescribed range through moving log-barriers. The untangling procedure starts from a possibly invalid curvilinear mesh and moves mesh vertices with the objective of producing elements that all have bounded Jacobians. Bounds on Jacobians are computed using the results of Johnen et al. (2012, 2013) [1,2]. The technique is applicable to any kind of polynomial element, for surface, volume, hybrid or boundary layer meshes. A series of examples demonstrate both the robustness and the efficiency of the technique. The final example, involving a time explicit computation, shows that it is possible to control the stable time step of the computation for curvilinear meshes through an alternative element deformation measure.

abstract = {Sequential multi-constraint graph partitioners have been developed to address the static load balancing requirements of multi-phase simulations. These work well when (i) the graph that models the computation fits into the memory of a single processor, and (ii) the simulation does not require dynamic load balancing. The efficient execution of very large or dynamically adapting multi-phase simulations on high-performance parallel computers requires that the multi-constraint partitionings are computed in parallel. This paper presents a parallel formulation of a multi-constraint graph-partitioning algorithm, as well as a new partitioning algorithm for dynamic multi-phase simulations. We describe these algorithms and give experimental results conducted on a 128-processor Cray T3E. These results show that our parallel algorithms are able to efficiently compute partitionings of similar edge-cuts as serial multi-constraint algorithms, and can scale to very large graphs. Our dynamic multi-constraint algorithm is also able to minimize the data redistribution required to balance the load better than a naive scratch-remap approach. We have shown that both of our parallel multi-constraint graph partitioners are as scalable as the widely-used parallel graph partitioner implemented in PARMETIS. Both of our parallel multi-constraint graph partitioners are very fast, as they are able to compute three-constraint 128-way partitionings of a 7.5 million vertex graph in under 7 s on 128 processors of a Cray T3E.
