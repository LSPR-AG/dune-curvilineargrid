 computational scheme for the solution of Maxwell´s
 equations in the time doman which is flexible and
 general enough to model geometrical details of
 varying degree of fineness. We investigate a finite

 optical microscopy during the last years. The finite difference time domain method, using an orthogonal
 discretization scheme, has often been used for full-wave three-dimensional studies. Because optical near-field
 configurations are often characterized by curvilinear shapes, locally refined, tetrahedral grids are better
 suited to describe the geometry. Where fine geometrical details must be resolved or the field solution is
 expected to vary rapidly, the elements are made smaller while in the other regions a coarser mesh can be used,
 thereby reducing the size of the problem and promoting computational efficiency. In this study, we use a finite
 element approach that solves the electric field vector wave (curl-curl) equation in the time domain (FETD)
 to investigate a novel, scanning near-field optical probe concept with asymmetric cladding. A specific advantage
 of the finite element method is its inherent capability to discretize the curl-curl equation in a non-uniform way.
 The finite element method is therefore particularly suited to approximate the geometry of an optical near-field
 configuration. We model a simplified setup, introduce specific approximations and discuss the method's capabilities
 and its potential for modeling more complex configurations.},

  Abstract                 = {The dyadic Green's function method is an attractive approach for the calculation of electromagnetic scattering
in spherically symmetric layered geometry. We investigate a recent formulation and reveal a problem that is
associated with the non- converging series that are employed for the calculation of the dyadic Green's function
in unbounded media. To overcome this deficiency we introduce a new formulation that gives the desired solution
analytically. The new technique combines operations on scalar Green's function with a rotation of the coordinate
system. Our formulation also accelerates the algorithm to evaluate the dyadic Green's function in spherically
multi-layered media. We present examples where we compare the conventional formulation with our new one.

In particular, the method includes transparent boundary conditions that enable the analysis of resonating structures in unbounded space. We demonstrate the performance of the method. First, we calculate the modes of several dielectric resonator antennas and compare them to theoretically determined results. Second, we calculate the modes of a nano-cuboid and compare them to theoretically determined results. Third, we numerically analyze spherical nanoparticles and compare the result to the theoretical Mie solution.
