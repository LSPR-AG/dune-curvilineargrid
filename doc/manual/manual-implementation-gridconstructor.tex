The grid construction is called by the \textit{Grid Factory} (see \ref{interface-grid-factory}) after all the vertices, elements and boundary segments have been inserted. The construction of the \curvgrid{} is in accordance with the following plan

\begin{mybox}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Construction of grid entities - Interior ($I$), Process Boundary ($PB$), Domain Boundary ($DB$) and Interior Boundary ($IB$) edges and faces.
	\item Construction of the global index for all entities. By default, the global index for vertices and elements is re-used from the mesh file.
	\item Construction of Ghost elements ($G$)
	\item Construction of entity subsets used for iteration over different entity partition types and codimensions
	\item Construction of communication maps, used to perform communication via the \textit{DataHandle} interface
	%\item Construction of OCTree for hierarchical element location
\end{enumerate}
\end{mybox}


\subsection{Storage}
\label{impl-grid-storage}

\noindent
The paradigm used in \curvgrid{} is to store all data corresponding to the grid in a single class, namely the \textit{CurvilinearGridStorage} class. Entities of each codimension are stored in arrays indexed by the local entity index, which is contiguous and starts from 0 on all processes. Each entity stores its global index, geometry type and partition type. For the detailed explanation on the correct assignment of partition types to entities of each codimension, the user is referred to the corresponding section of \dune{} grid usage manual, found on the website of the project. Elements and faces also store the associated material (physical) tag. Elements store the local index of all interpolatory vertices in the \textit{Sorted Cartesian} order (see \cref{impl-gmsh-numbering-convention}). The edges and faces do not store the interpolatory vertex indices, as it would be wasteful for higher curvilinear orders. Instead, each edge and face is stored as a subentity of an associated parent element - any of the elements containing it. Thus, each subentity stores the parent element local index, as well as the subentity index, by which the subentity is indexed within the reference element. Finally, each face stores its boundary type - Interior, Domain Boundary or Periodic Boundary, as well as the index of the 2nd parent element that shares it. By convention, the primary parent element must always be interior to the process storing the face. The secondary parent element may be either interior, or Ghost (\cref{fig:impl:ghostelements}). The data associated with a Ghost element is stored on the neighboring process, but can be accessed from this process as part of interprocessor communication. In case of Domain Boundaries, there is no secondary parent. By convention, any attempts to access the secondary parent of a Domain Boundary result in an exception, as the user code must take the provided partition type into account when addressing neighboring entities. \\

\noindent
\curvgrid{} contains several different local index sets, designed to uniquely index only the entities of a given subset. Namely, Domain Boundary segments, Interior Boundary segments, Process Boundaries, remaining Interior boundaries, as well as Ghost elements each have their own local index. \curvgrid{} provides maps between those indices and local indices of all entities of a given codimension. In addition, there is a unique index for grid corners, namely the interpolatory vertices that define the linear entities (\cref{fig:impl:storage:vertexvscorner}). This is necessary, because the \dune{} facade class operates in terms of linear elements, and thus requires a contiguous index for the corners. Importantly, among all vertices only entity corners possess unique process boundary index, since, for all interprocessor communication purposes, the mesh can be assumed to be linear without loss of generality. Finally, a map from global to local index is provided for entities of all codimensions. \\

\begin{figure}
    \centering
	\includegraphics[scale=1.5]{images/vertex-vs-corner}
	\caption{The interpolatory vertices of the 5th order curvilinear triangle. Corners are given in red}
	\label{fig:impl:storage:vertexvscorner}
\end{figure}

\noindent
\curvgrid{} operates with two different types of \textit{GlobalIds}, designed to uniquely identify the entity among all processes. First of all, it is a pre-requisite that all vertices have an associated global index, which is either re-used from the mesh file, or constructed in the beginning of the grid construction procedure. Before the global indices for other codimensions are generated, these entities are uniquely identified by the sorted set of global indices of the entity corners, which can be used in a map to determine if a given communicated entity is already present on the receiving process. Later, when entities of all codimensions possess global index, the \textit{GlobalId} is simply a wrapper of the global index, such as to use minimal amount of resources necessary. It is the latter \textit{GlobalId} that is made available for the user code at the end of construction procedure. \\

\noindent
For the purposes of iterating over frequently used entity subsets, the corresponding local index subsets are provided for each codimension. Namely, subsets are provided for all entities of a given codimension, Interior entities, Process Boundary entities, Domain Boundary entities, Ghost entities, Interior + Domain Boundaries (called \textit{interior} in \dune{}), Interior + Domain Boundaries + Process Boundaries (called \textit{interior border} in \dune{}). \\

\noindent
For communication purposes, all communicating entities need to store a vector of ranks of processes with which these entities are shared. For more details on communicating entities, see \cref{impl-grid-constructor-comm}.




\subsection{Global index construction}
\label{impl-grid-constructor-globalindex}

\noindent
In this section we briefly describe the algorithm used to construct the global indices for all codimensions. The challenge in computing the global indices comes from the fact that originally the processes are not aware of their neighbors. Due to the insertion of complete boundary segments by the grid factory, each process can readily identify all of its process boundaries as the faces that have only one containing element on the process and are not already marked as domain boundaries. The algorithm has four definite stages - determining the neighboring process for each process boundary, assigning (virtual) ownership of each shared entity to only one of the processes sharing it, enumerating the global index on processes owning the entities, and communicating the global index to all other processes containing each shared entity. \\

\noindent
The algorithm starts by determining neighbor ranks of each Process Boundary ($PB$) corner. Currently, each process communicates all process boundary corner global indices to all other processes. From the received global indices each process can deduce all other processes sharing each of its corners. Then, each process assigns provisional neighbor processes to edges and faces by considering the processes that share all entity corners. If two processes share all the corners of a given entity, it does not mean that they share the entity as well (\cref{fig:impl:globalindex:fakeedge}). The ambiguity is quite rare, because most entities are shared only by two processes, and since each process boundary entity must be shared by at least two processes, there is no need to check if the entity exists. Nevertheless, the grid must be able to handle the rare case of an entity being shared by more than two processes. In this case, the edge and face \textit{GlobalIds} (see \cref{impl-grid-storage}) are communicated to all provisional neighboring processes. Each of the provisional neighbor processes then responds, whether or not each entity corner set corresponds to an entity. The ranks that are not confirmed to share the entities are then removed from the neighbor list. \\

\begin{figure}
    \centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/parallel-fake-edge}
	\captionsetup{width = 0.8\textwidth}
	\caption{The two yellow vertices are shared between three processes. The edge in-between them only exists on red and green processes, but not on the blue one}
	\label{fig:impl:globalindex:fakeedge}
\end{figure}

\noindent
For each $PB$ edge and face, an owner is determined. The ownership strategy is flexible, as long as all processes agree. Currently, a shared entity is considered to be owned the process with the lowest rank among those sharing it. Each process owns all of its non-shared entities. The number of entities owned by each process is then communicated to all other processes. \\

\noindent
Each process then locally enumerates the global index of all its entities. To begin with, each process computes the shift in global index due to the entities of each codimension enumerated by the processes with ranks lower than this process rank. All processes enumerate global indices consecutively, starting with 0 on rank 0 process. This constructs a global index individually for each codimension. A global index over all entities is also constructed, shifting the enumeration also by all the enumerated entities of higher codimension. \\

\noindent
The enumerated global indices are then communicated among all processes sharing the entities. By analyzing entity neighbors, each process can compute how many global indices it needs to send to and receive from each other process, avoiding extra communication. At the end of this process, the global-to-local index map is filled on each process.


\subsection{Periodic boundary construction}
\label{impl-grid-constructor-periodic}

A recent feature of the \curvgrid is the Periodic Boundary Condition (PBC) support for cuboid domains. It is possible to have any 1, 2 or 3 dimensions periodic. \curvgrid supports Periodic Boundaries and the associated Ghost Entities. \\

\noindent
In order to generate a Periodic mesh it is sufficient to provide a periodic-conformal .msh file. This means that the Domain Boundary must be a cuboid surface, and all faces on parallel cuboid planes, for which periodicity is specified, should be conformal. That is, the conformal faces must exactly match via translation along the orthogonal axis (\cref{fig:impl:periodicconformal}). There is no need to provide any periodicity information in the .msh file - the periodic faces are recognized automatically. In order to inform the grid constructor of the periodicity, it is sufficient to pass to the \textit{CurvilinearGridFactory} an additional parameter, denoting which dimensions are expected to be parallel (see \cref{interface-grid-factory}) \\

\begin{figure}
    \centering
	\includegraphics[scale=1.5]{images/periodic-conform}
	\captionsetup{width = 0.8\textwidth}
	\caption{The image demonstrates that a conformal periodic face pair is such that one of them can be obtained from the other through translation along the periodicity axis}
	\label{fig:impl:periodicconformal}
\end{figure}


\noindent
Currently the construction of the periodic boundary relies on gathering all the periodic faces on the master process, determining periodic neighbors, and scattering the neighboring information to the boundary owner processes.

\begin{mybox}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Master process gathers the global indices of all periodic boundary faces, as well as their corner coordinates. 
 \item It separates all periodic faces into 6 arrays, with normals $-X$, $+X$, $-Y$, $+Y$, $-Z$, $+Z$ (non-periodic dimensions are ignored)
 \item For each periodic face the Center of Mass (CoM) is calculated, and each array is sorted w.r.t center of mass.
 \item If the mesh is indeed conformal, the each two arrays of opposite normals should now have the periodic neighbors in exactly the same order. Thus the periodic face pairs are found.
 \item For each face pair, the corresponding vertices are matched by checking that the vector connecting them is collinear with the face normal. The relative permutation index of vertices is calculated
 \item For each process its periodic neighbor information is communicated - the neighbor global index pair, as well as the permutation index.
\end{enumerate}
\end{mybox}

\noindent
IMPORTANT NOTE: The orientation of each boundary face is determined by the reference subentity orientation of the corresponding element, and thus does not follow any global pattern. Thus, any two periodic neighbor faces are conformal up to a permutation of indices. Since the grid element vertex indexing does not change, the permutation of indices also stays the same. It is therefore essential for each process to know the permutation that needs to be applied to its periodic face, such that it matches to the periodic face of the neighbor process. It is later used in the intersection implementation to link together the local indices of the neighboring elements within the shared face. \\

\noindent
It is important to note that the intersection is viewed as a subentity of its inner neighbor element. Should we construct the intersection of the other neighboring element (for which it will be the inner element), corresponding to the same face, the orientation of the face may change, depending on the vertex ordering of that element. The typical way to perform the face orientation matching for neighbor elements in \dune{} is to construct neighboring local geometries \textit{geometryInInside} and \textit{geometryInOutside} for each intersection. These geometries are maps from the local coordinate of a face to the corresponding local coordinate of the containing element, namely

\begin{mybox}
\begin{lstlisting}
  LocalCoordinate3D insideElementLocalCoordinate = geometryInInside. global(localFaceCoordinate)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{mybox}

\noindent
The above design pattern makes use of two important observations
\begin{itemize}
 \item The coordinates of the \textit{geometryInInside} are a subset of the coordinates of a 3D reference element, which exactly correspond to the corners of the face, viewed as a subentity of the inner reference element.
 \item The coordinates of the \textit{geometryInOutside} are a subset of the coordinates of a 3D reference element, which exactly correspond to the corners of the face, viewed as a subentity of the outer reference element, followed by a permutation. The permutation the permutation that needs to be applied to the corners of the face, as seen from the inner element, to correspond to the corners of that face, as seen from the outer element.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
For example, a given face is the $s0=$2nd subentity of the inner element, and the $s1=$0th subentity of the outer element (out of 4 possible). Also, assume that the order of vertices in inner and outer elements is such, that the corners of the face as seen from the inner element would map to the corners, as seen from the outer element as $M = (0,1,2) \rightarrow (2,0,1)$. As of time of writing, the \dune{} tetrahedral reference element is such, that its corner coordinates are $pref=\{(0.0\ 0.0\ 0.0), (1.0\ 0.0\ 0.0), (0.0\ 1.0\ 0.0), (0.0\ 0.0\ 1.0)\}$ and the indices corresponding to the reference subentity faces are $fref=\{(0 1 2), (0 1 3), (0 2 3), (1 2 3)\}$. Thus, the corners of the \textit{geometryInInside} are

\begin{mybox}
\begin{lstlisting}
 pref[fref[s0]] = pref[fref[2]] = {pref[0], pref[2], pref[3]}
   = {(0.0 0.0 0.0), (0.0 1.0 0.0), (0.0 0.0 1.0)}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{mybox}

\noindent
and of the \textit{geometryInOutside} are
\begin{mybox}
\begin{lstlisting}
 M[pref[fref[s1]]] = M[pref[fref[0]]]
   = M[{pref[0], pref[1], pref[2]}] = {pref[2], pref[0], pref[1]}
   = {(0.0 1.0 0.0), (0.0 0.0 0.0), (1.0 0.0 0.0)}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{mybox}

\noindent
Currently in \curvgrid{}, for the entities that share a face, the necessary permutation is generated upon construction of the intersection, by simply matching the local indices of the face, as seen from inner and outer neighbor elements. For the periodic boundaries, this information might not be locally available, if ghost elements are not constructed, and the determination of the permutation is a tedious procedure with multiple floating point comparisons. Thus, for periodic boundaries, the permutation index is calculated once during the construction, then stored and reused for intersection construction. \\

\noindent
As a result, calculating coupling integrals over any intersection, including periodic, follows exactly the same procedure, and no additional effort is necessary from the user (see tutorial \cref{usage-howto-tutorial-periodic}) \\





\textbf{[TODO]} Append changes to communication \\






\subsection{Ghost element construction}
\label{impl-grid-constructor-ghost}

\noindent
Ghost entities are the subentities of the element on the other side of the process or periodic boundary face, including the element itself. The process and periodic boundary entities themselves can be part of a Ghost entity, but are not considered Ghost entities. Thus, the Ghost entities are the entities of \textit{InteriorBorder} partition (on their parent process) normally not present on this process, but are borrowed by this process. On the borrowing process, the ghost entities have the partition type \textit{GhostEntity}. The ghost entities due to a periodic boundary are treated exactly the same way as those due to a process boundary, with the exception that all of the process boundaries of a ghost element are the same local process boundaries, whereas for each periodic boundary a ghost element has another ghost face, which corresponds to that periodic boundary, but is disjoint from it, and has different local and global index (\cref{fig:impl:periodicvsprocessboundary}). Another special case are the ghost elements of the periodic boundaries, for which the periodic neighbor element is also local to the same process. In this case, no \textbf{ghost element is constructed}, and no entities are copied. The outer neighbor element of the periodic boundary in that case is simply specified as the local element on the other side. Local periodic neighbors are treated during the periodic construction \cref{impl-grid-constructor-periodic}, whereas this section only deals with non-local periodic neighbors. \\

\noindent
Construction of Ghost entities involves communicating all the information associated with the entities to the neighboring processes, and then incorporating the Ghost entities into the grid on the receiving side (\cref{fig:impl:ghostelements}). \\

\begin{figure}
    \centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/parallel-ghost-elements}
	\caption{The first image depicts two neighboring processes without Ghost elements. The second and third images contain only the first and only the second process entities respectively, including Ghost elements borrowed from the other process. }
	\label{fig:impl:ghostelements}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
	\includegraphics[scale=1.5]{images/periodic-vs-process-boundary}
	\captionsetup{width = 0.8\textwidth}
	\caption{This image explains the difference between process boundary ghost elements (left), periodic ghost elements (center), and local periodic neighbors(right). In the left-most image, the green process borrows an element from the red process via a process boundary. That element becomes a ghost. Both the interior green element and the ghost element share the yellow process boundary face. In the center, the green process borrows an element from the red process via a periodic boundary. That element becomes a ghost. The ghost element stays in the same geometric position, and is completely disjoint from its periodic neighbour. The right-most image demonstrates periodic neighbour elements for the case, when both neighboring periodic boundaries are on the same process (blue). In this case, nothing is borrowed or copied, only that each of the neighboring elements considers the other a neighbor. It is important to note that both the coordinates and the global and local indices of periodic neighbors are completely disjoint, thus allowing to address these entities individually. }
	\label{fig:impl:periodicvsprocessboundary}
\end{figure}

\noindent
Since for every $PB$ and \textit{Periodic} face the neighboring process rank has already been determined in the previous sections, and the global index is already known, it remains only to communicate the corresponding neighbor entities and correctly integrate them into the local grid. Firstly, one needs to communicate the properties of the structure to be communicated. Thus, for each interior element next to the boundary the interpolation order is communicated, as well as the number of boundary faces it shares with the receiving side. It is important to note that a Ghost element can have more than one boundary face associated to it, and the receiving side does not know in advance if one, two or three of its boundary faces are associated with the same Ghost element on the other side. This is also the reason it is not possible to know in advance how many ghosts will be received from a neighbor process. Afterwards, for each Ghost element the global index, physical tag, global indices of all codimension subentities and subentity indices of boundary faces of the boundary-interior elements are communicated. The corresponding Ghost elements are then added to the mesh, and it is determined which vertex coordinates are missing. The vertex coordinates are not communicated immediately, because the neighbor process may already have some of the global coordinates due to narrow mesh appendices. Thus, each process communicates the number of vertex coordinates missing from each of its neighbors, and then communicates the missing coordinates.




\subsection{Communication interface construction}
\label{impl-grid-constructor-comm}

The communication paradigm of \dune{} \textit{DataHandle} interface is to communicate data between instances of the same entity on different processes. Depending on the communication protocol, only entities of specific structural types will communicate. We will slightly redefine the partition type classes in this section for compactness reasons. There are three different communicating partition types
\begin{itemize}
	\item $PB$ - Process boundary entities, that is, process boundary faces and their subentities
	\item $I$ - Interior entities, including the $DB$ but excluding the $PB$ entities.
	\item $G$ - Ghost elements and their subentities, excluding $PB$
	\item $PERB$ - Periodic Boundaries
\end{itemize}

	\caption{ Partition type pairs that can communicate to each other}
	\label{fig:impl:comm:partitionpairs}
\end{figure}

\noindent
A special case is the recently added periodic communication $PERB \rightarrow PERB$. Currently it is only implemented for periodic faces (not yet the edges and vertices). Each periodic boundary communicates with its neighbor on the other process. By convention, if both periodic boundaries are on the same process, they do not communicate, as that would result in entities sending data to themselves. Also, the user must be aware that in all cases except the periodic communication the sending and receiving entities have the same global index, and the same position in space. The periodic boundaries communicate to each other, while being spatially-separated, and having different global indices. Note also, that ghost elements generated by periodic boundaries also participate in all above protocols, and are in principle the same, as the ghosts, generated by the process boundaries, except that they are disjoint from the boundary (see \cref{fig:impl:periodicvsprocessboundary}). \\


\noindent
We consider all partition type pairs, for which the \textit{DataHandle} communication is possible (\cref{fig:impl:comm:partitionpairs}). Note that interior entities only communicate to Ghost and vice-versa, because Process Boundaries are Process Boundaries on both neighboring processes. However, Process Boundaries can communicate to Ghosts and vice-versa, because a process boundary can be a Ghost with respect to a third process at the triple point. \\

\noindent
The \textit{DataHandle} interface foresees four communication protocols. The \cref{table:impl:datahandle:protocols} presents the communication interfaces used by Dune, and explains how they translate to communication between entities of above specified partition types \\

\begin{table}

\end{table}


\noindent
The aim of this part of the grid constructor is to generate/reuse unique index maps for the sets $PB$, $I$ and $G$. Then, for every communicating entity, for every possible partition type pair, we require an array of ranks of the processes for which such communication is possible. Note that the map for the pair $PB\rightarrow PB$ already exists, it is constructed in the very beginning of the grid construction procedure to enable global indices and Ghost elements. The algorithm is as follows:

\begin{mybox}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Mark the neighbor process ranks of the associated $PB$ for all $I$ and $G$ entities, whose containing elements neighbor $PB$, thus enabling the $I \rightarrow G$ and $G \rightarrow I$ communication. Note that entities of all (!!) codimensions can have more than one neighbor rank obtained this way. During the marking, elements with two or more process boundaries from different processes may be encountered. In that case, for each process boundary entity the rank of the other process boundary is marked, thus providing some information for the future construction of the $PB \rightarrow G$ communications.
	\item Then, all entities that can communicate are associated with ranks of all other processes, over which the entities are shared.% It remains to finish the $PB \rightarrow G$ communication, and calculate the remaining protocols $G \rightarrow I$, $G \rightarrow PB$ and $G \rightarrow G$.
	\item For all $PB$ entities, subtract $PB\rightarrow PB$ set from the $PB \rightarrow G$ set to ensure that the latter excludes the former. Also, mark the number of effective $PB \rightarrow G$ candidate entities of each codimension for each process
	\item For all $PB$ entities with non-empty $PB \rightarrow G$ set, communicate $G$ indices to all neighboring $PB$ entities
	\item For all $PB$, append the union of the received $G$ to the $PB \rightarrow G$ set, thus completing it %(hopefully)
	\item For all $PB$ entities with non-zero $PB \rightarrow G$, communicate self index to all $G$ of $PB \rightarrow G$ set
	\item For all $G$, append the union of the received $PB$ to the $G \rightarrow PB$ set, thus completing it %(hopefully)
	\item For all $PB$ entities with non-zero $PB \rightarrow G$, communicate to all own $G$ neighbors all the other $G$ in the set
		%\subitem Optimization - do this only if you are lowest rank among all $PB$-neighbors
		%\subitem Further optimization - do this only if you are modulus-rank among all $PB$-neighbors
	\item For all $G$, append the union of the received $G$ to the $G \rightarrow G$ set, thus completing it %(hopefully)	
\end{enumerate}
\end{mybox}
