% BEGIN OF ABSTRACT

\vfill

\noindent \textbf{\textsc{ABSTRACT}} - We introduce the \texttt{dune-curvilineargrid} module. The module provides the self-contained, parallel grid manager \texttt{dune-curvilineargrid}, as well as the underlying elementary curvilinear geometry class \texttt{dune-curvilineargeometry}. Both modules are developed as extension of \text{DUNE} \citeDune project, and conform the corresponding standard interface. We expect the reader to be at least briefly familiar with the Dune interface to fully benefit from this paper.
%%
This work is carried out by a technology company. It is motivated by reliable and scalable design of nanooptical devices, carried out by our family of electromagnetic codes which run on a full 3D realistic geometries. Curvilinear geometries improve both the accuracy of modeling smooth material boundaries, and the convergence rate of PDE solutions with increasing basis function order \cite{fahs2011}, reducing the computational effort required for robust modeling.
%%
\texttt{dune-curvilineargeometry} is capable to model simplex entities (edges, triangles and tetrahedrons) up to polynomial order 5 hard-coded, and up to arbitrary order via analytical procedures. Its most notable features are local-to-global and global-to-local maps, analytical and adaptive integration, explicit polynomial operators (e.g. Jacobians and Integration Elements), caching, series of self-tests.
%%
\texttt{dune-curvilineargrid} uses \texttt{dune-curvilineargeometry} to provide the following functionality: fully parallel input of curvilinear meshes in the \texttt{gmsh}\citeGMSH mesh format, processing only the corresponding part of the mesh on each available core; mesh partitioning by the reader (using \texttt{Parmetis} \citeParMetis); unique global indices for all mesh entities over all processes; ghost elements associated with the interprocessor boundaries; interprocessor communication of data for all entities of the mesh via the standard \text{DUNE} data handle interface.
%%
The \texttt{dune-curvilineargrid} grid manager is continuously developed and improved. Among other things, we are working on higher order basis functions, non-uniform h and p-refinement, periodicity and internal boundaries, as well as dense communication protocols, which may become interesting for the implementation of hybrid finite-element-boundary-integral (FEBI) discretisation schemes.
%%
As more work is being done on \texttt{dune-curvilineargrid}, this document will be updated. For the most recent version of the documentation, as well as for the source codes please refer to the following repositories: \\
