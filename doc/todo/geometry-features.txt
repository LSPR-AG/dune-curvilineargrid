Notable curviliear geometry features:

[ ] Implements polynomial class, that can manage polynomials of arbitrary order and dimension
  [ ] Notable features include: arithmetic operations (same monomial terms are merged), evaluation at a given point, partial derivatives, integrals over reference simplex of dimensions(1,2,3)
  [ ] Optimized to auto-delete terms of insignificant relative magnitude for performance
[ ] Supports Curvilinear Simplex geometries of dimensions dim = {0,1,2,3}
  [ ] Order 1-5 interpolatory polynomials given explicitly (hard-coded for speed)
  [ ] Arbitrary order interpolatory polynomiala given implicitly (computed dynamically via polynomial class)
  [ ] Features include
    [ ] Local->Global mapping via lagrange polynomials
    [ ] Global->Local mapping via amortized Newton method

[ ] TODO-Cleanup
  [+] Split GMSH2DuneMapper class
  [ ] Check if Grid-testing works with command line param
  [ ] Change all CurvilinearGrid boolean parameters to automatic in all places
