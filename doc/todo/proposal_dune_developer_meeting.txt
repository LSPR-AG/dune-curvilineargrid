Factory

     *  [FIXME] Currently, physical tag is inserted explicitly, which may be unsatisfactory for Dune community.
     *          A possible workaround is to create compiler directive -DHAVE_PHYSICAL_TAG, which would determine
     *          whether to use extra argument in the factory.insertElement() routine

     *  [FIXME] Currently factory.insertBoundarySegment() inserts index of element associated with this element, which Dune might not like:
     *  Possible solutions:
     *    * Extend Dune-interface with this function. Otherwise inserting boundary segment is pointless - having to find which element this boundary segment is associated with
     *    * Recompute in CurvGrid - not too expensive to redo, but annoying
     *    * Introduce compiler directive -DHAVE_CURVREADER_BOUNDARY_SEGMENT_ASSOCIATION


Grid-Interface
[ ] sizeGlobal(codim)      - returns number of entities over all processes
[ ] size(codim, partition) - returns number of entities on a given partition (e.g. Interior / Border / Ghost)
[ ] Iterator over BoundarySegments, can return an entity of type face or an IntersectionIterator

Capability
[ ] bool support_curv_entity

Entity
[ ] polynomial_order()     - returns the polynomial order of the element

Geometry
[ ] local() is not defined for curv if the point is not inside the element
  [ ] Suggest users to go away from paradigm of using local as replacement of isInside method, as it does not extend to curv
  [ ] propose local() method that has 2 return variables (isInside, localC), where localC is only defined if isInside==true
