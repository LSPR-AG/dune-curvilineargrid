Faraway goals of CurvilinearGrid and geometry
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] Curvilinear Hexahedral Geometries and Grids
[ ] Lower mydim geometries
  [ ] 2D in 3D, to allow floating surfaces. Sometimes only a surface is required, e.g. BoundaryIntegral, or dual mesh
[ ] 2D Geometries
[ ] Thread-safety

----------------------------------------------------------------------
CurvilinearGeometry
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] CurvilinearGeometryHelper - optimize extraction of subentity vertices



----------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO-List for Curvilinear Geometry and Curvilinear Grid
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] Simplify curvilinear geometry
  [ ] Split CurvGeometry and CachedGeometry to separate files
  [ ] Non-cached geometry is pointless. There is no computational advantage in not precomputing maps, and memory gain is irrelevant since nobody would store an array of geometries
    [ ] Have one geometry with pointer-based storage for all possible derived quantities. Initialize each quantity whenever it is computed as in Intersection
  [ ] Specialize CurvilinearGeometry class for different CODIM

[ ] CurvilinearGMSHReader
  [ ] gmsh2dune mapping is imperfect. I assume that GMSH always picks axis of element in such a way that detJ would be always positive. Then the mapper swaps y and z axis, and it becomes always negative, which causes unnecessary work

[ ] Scalability of CurvilinearGrid
  [ ] CurvGMSHReader to work with generic factories and thus AluGrid
  [ ] Constructor to optionally not require boundary segment insertion
  [ ] CurvGrid to function without ghost elements. To make relevant tests




Cleanup
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] Cleanup
  [ ] Introduce IndexTypes and FACECODIMs in GmshReader
  [ ] Replace all DUNE_THROW output by the logging message output such that it can be read
  [ ] Put correct exceptions for DUNE_THROW
  [ ] Insert asserts for all MPI_Communication outputs to make sure received data is always expected
  [ ] Insert asserts in GridBase, checking for existence of requested entities in all methods
  [ ] DOxygen
    [ ] Put \brief everywhere
    [ ] Run DOxygen once just to see how Algorighm lists appear, expect to have some work to do on it


Optimization
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] Optimization-Constructor
  [ ] Compactify construction. Try not to construct same structures (like BoundaryInternals) several times at different stages of the code
     [ ] Communication
       [ ] Go from 2D and 3D comm arrays to 1D displacement arrays to avoid double storage
       [ ] Generic communication functions to reuse and shorten code
       [ ] Nearest neighbour paradigm, removing all length-size arrays
     [ ] Algorithmic Bottlenecks
       [ ] Finding nEntitiesBeforeMe involves allgather of that nEntity over all elements
         [ ] Idea No1: Construct smallest enclosing circle for each process, communicate center and radius to all other processes.
             Only consider neighbor candedates those for which the circles intersect. Requires 1 All2All communication, but not proportional to boundary size like currently
       [ ] Finding corner neighbor ranks involves allgather in a loop

[ ] Optimization - Integration
  [ ] Implementing nested quadrature rules (e.g. Gauss-Kronrod or Clenshawâ€“Curtis, see works by J.Waldvogel)
  [ ] Implementing (Smolyak-like) sparse grid that is more efficient than direct product grid

[ ] Optimization-CurvilinearVTKWriter:
  [+] Allow adding tetrahedral elements to VTK and VTU
  [+] Allow adding field functor sets to VTK and VTU
  [ ] If explosion is off, and neighbour discretization order the same, reuse discretization vertices shared by neighbor elements 
    [ ] Map discretization vertices with a key including bounding vertices and displacements
  [ ] Use std::function or dune::function to define functions accepted by the VTKWriter
    [ ] Allow more optimal VTK writer syntax, where the whole coordinate is passed, not its component
    

     

Features
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] Interface
  [ ] grid.size(codim, partitionType)    - extend grid.size interface, replacing numInterior and numProcessBoundaries. Propose extend to DUNE PPL as generic
  [ ] grid.sizeCurvilinear(codim == dim) - method to output number of curved vertices

[ ] LoggingMessage
  [+] Convert LoggingMessage to a singleton, never store it, only initialize once and request write operations
  [+] remove Boost dependence, insert c++ standard time instead
  [+] Implement static write procedure such that write singleton can be called as LoggingMessage::write(args)
  [+] Implement and insert new formalism with hierarchic DVERB levels
  [ ] Insert new formalism into CurvGrid and Hades3d
  [ ] Put correct DVERB levels for all output
  [ ] introduce file writing option for parallel output. Make logging message a proper class, with option of file output upon init
   
[ ] LoggingTimer
  [+] Implement LoggingTimer as a Singleton. Operation LoggingTimer::time(name, opts)
  [+] Measures time elapsed between the two calls of the method, and stores it
  [+] Can output logging time, serial and parallel, with min max and avg time per process
  [ ] Outputs timing hierarchically as a tree, when routines were called one inside another
  [ ] If routine called inside a loop, the timing contributions from each call are summed up, number of calls returned
  [ ] Add option to compute the memory used at the beginning and the end of computation
    [ ] See if memory check can be scheduled to run while, say, SuperLUDist is running
  
[ ] GridDiagnostics
  [ ] Write Matlab routine to analyse diagnostics output of grid-diagnostics
  [ ] Possibly enable writing diagnostics to CSV to analyse with Excel
  
  
Testing
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[+] Implement extra test for integration of a matrix, and set of matrices
